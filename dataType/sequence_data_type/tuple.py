#tuple : collection of data items(data structured) which is immutable (unchangable),
# order and allow duplicate value

a=("ashiwn","ram",66,4.5)

# print(len(a))
# print(type(a))
# print(a)

# print(a[-1])
# print(a[1:3])

# a[0]="hari"
# print(a)

# print(a.index("ashiwn"))
# print(a.count("ashwin"))


# difference between tuple and list

#list : we can modify or update data, [], performance is slower due to mutable
#tuple : we cannot modify or update data, (), performance is faster as compare to list

#unpack tuple
# a="ashiwn","ram","hari"
# print(type(a))
# print(a)

# a,*b=1,2,3,4

# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(type(b))

# a=[a]
# print(type(a))
